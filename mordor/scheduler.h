/// the thread it was created on (by passing useCaller = true in the
/// constructor), spawn multiple threads of its own, or a hybrid of the two.
///
/// Hijacking and Schedulers begin processing fibers when either
/// yieldTo() or dispatch() is called. The Scheduler will stop itself when
/// there are no more Fibers scheduled, and return from yieldTo() or
/// dispatch(). Hybrid and spawned Schedulers must be explicitly stopped via
/// stop(). stop() will return only after there are no more Fibers scheduled.
