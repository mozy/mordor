/// @brief Run a process as a daemon
///
/// Runs daemonMain as a daemon process, that can be externally controlled.
/// It is cross platform, and will adapt for how this process is run.
/// The words in parenthesis describe behavior for how the signal handler
/// interacts with the platform's normal actions:
///     * default: if no slots are connected to the signal, it gets passed
///       to the default handler for that platform
///     * always: the default handler for that platform is always invoked
///       (after all slots are signalled)
///     * ignored: the default handler for that platform is ignored
///     * ExitProcess: there is no default handler for a Windows System Service
///       so a stop request that is unhandled will terminate the process
///
/// Windows Console:
///     * argc/argv are passed through
///     * Ctrl-C triggers onInterrupt (default)
///     * Ctrl-Break and End Task trigger onTerminate (default)
///
/// Windows System Service:
///     * argc/argv are ignored; daemonMain receives the arguments from
///       ServiceStart
///     * SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP triggers onTerminate (ExitProcess)
///     * SERVICE_CONTROL_PAUSE triggers onPause (ignored)
///     * SERVICE_CONTROL_CONTINUE triggers onContinue (ignored)
///     * SERVICE_CONTROL_PARAMCHANGE triggers onReload (ignored)
///
/// POSIX:
///     * argc/argv are passed through
///     * SIGTERM triggers onTerminate (default)
///     * SIGINT triggers onInterrupt (default)
///     * SIGTSTP triggers onPause (always)
///     * SIGCONT triggers onContinue (always)
///     * SIGHUP triggers onReload (default)
///
/// @note On Windows run automagically determines if it is being run as a
///       system service or from the console.
///       On OS X, you should be using launchd, and never daemonize.
///       On Linux, run attempts to automagically determine if it needs to
///       daemonize by seeing if it is being run directly from an script in
///       /etc/init.d, or by start-stop-daemon (Debian)
/// @note In all cases, the signals are invoked on a thread separate from
///       the thread daemonMain is called on, or any that it created
/// @note run should be called *exactly* once, since the signals are global
///       for the process
